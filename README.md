# Hearing Quantum Evolution
When a quantum state evolves, there are 2^n basis states whose probability amplitudes and phases evolve. Quantum states may be represented in a [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space), and their evolution may be modeled by unitary matrices from which 2^n wave patterns may be derived, each having amplitude and frequency. 

Unfortunately, nature doesn't permit us to observe, or rather listen to, a quantum state evolving. However, quantum simulators such as those supplied in Qiskit may be employed to model this evolution and compute its wave patterns. These oscillations could be used as a starting point in traditional audio synthesis, so that we may listen to unobservable but fundamental melodies and harmonies baked into the universe and happening all around us.
